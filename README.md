# Maven Field Glossary

This repository is Maven Asset Management Solutions’ executive-level glossary of the terms used in:

Each definition is written in plain English, grounded in outcomes, and intended for the leaders responsible for execution.

## Why We Built This

- Reliability that reduces surprise failures
- Governance that sustains standards
- Data leaders can trust
- Work management that improves predictability

This glossary is Maven’s contribution to clearer conversations and stronger execution across the asset management community.
