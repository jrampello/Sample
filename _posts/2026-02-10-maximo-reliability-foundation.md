title: "The Reliability Foundation Most Maximo Programs Miss"

## Executive Takeaway
Most organizations don’t fail at IBM Maximo because of the software.  
They fail because they implement Maximo without a reliability foundation that supports consistent execution.

Maximo becomes powerful when it is treated as a **system of discipline**, not just a system of record.

---

## The Problem: Maximo Can’t Fix What Isn’t Defined
Many asset-intensive organizations invest in Maximo expecting immediate improvements in performance.

But without clear standards, Maximo simply records inconsistent behavior:

- PMs are created but not followed
- Work orders are opened but not coded consistently
- Failure history exists, but the data is unreliable
- Leadership asks for reporting, but reporting is disconnected from decision-making

This creates a common frustration:

> “We have Maximo, but we’re not getting value from it.”

---

## The Root Cause: Reliability Is Not a Technology Feature
Reliability is not a module.  
Reliability is an operating model.

Maximo supports reliability only when an organization has agreement on:

- how work is prioritized
- how assets are classified
- how failures are described
- what "good data" actually means
- how standards are enforced over time

Without those definitions, the system becomes a digital filing cabinet.

## What the Best Programs Do Differently
Successful Maximo organizations treat reliability strategy as a leadership discipline.

They build three fundamentals before scaling advanced capabilities:

### 1. Asset Hierarchy That Matches Reality
A clean asset hierarchy ensures maintenance history reflects the true structure of the plant, facility, or network.

If the hierarchy is inconsistent, reporting becomes misleading.

### 2. Work Management Discipline
Reliable operations require predictable execution.

That means:
- clear work order categories
- consistent planning and scheduling
- standard failure codes
- clear accountability for closeout quality

### 3. Governance That Doesn’t Fade
The best organizations build governance into the rhythm of operations:
- monthly data quality reviews
- quarterly reliability strategy refresh
- clear standards for PM and job plan updates

Governance is what keeps Maximo valuable after the project team leaves.

---

## Why This Matters for Asset Performance
When these fundamentals are in place, Maximo becomes a strategic platform:

- reliability trends become measurable
- asset performance becomes visible
- maintenance becomes predictable
- leadership can make decisions using real data

This is where organizations begin shifting from reactive maintenance to proactive reliability improvement.

---

## Maven Perspective
Maximo implementations succeed when the program is built around reliability outcomes, not technical milestones.

The most important question is not:

> “Did we install Maximo correctly?”

It is:

> “Did we implement discipline that will still exist 12 months from now?”

---

## What to Do Next (Simple Starting Point)
If you want to improve reliability using Maximo, start here:

1. Validate the asset hierarchy (is it accurate and usable?)
2. Standardize work order closeout rules (failure coding, labor, downtime)
3. Establish governance (monthly reviews, defined ownership)
4. Build reporting that drives decisions, not dashboards
